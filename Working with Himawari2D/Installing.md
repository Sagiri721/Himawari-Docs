The first step to work with Himawari2D is installing the engine, and the HimawariSDK application.
To start working with the Himawari2D game engine all you need is to download the engine source code and start coding, but to really start working with your projects you should use the project wizard from the HimawariSDK.

* Download the engine from the source code here [Himawari2D source code](https://github.com/Sagiri721/Himawari-2d)
