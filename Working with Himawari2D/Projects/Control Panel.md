The control panel is a component that allows for the easy execution of common functions, such as creating objects, alarms, and shaders. Creating shaders and alarms can be done with just a file name, but when creating an object, we can perform a more complex initialization using the advanced object creation tool illustrated in Figure 107. As seen, it is possible to define a layer and a tag for the object we are creating. More importantly, we can customize the components with which this object will be instantiated. The list of components includes all the components that come with the Himawari2D paradigm, and when we add a component, a dialog may appear requesting information related to the component being added. Once added, we can use the button with an "X" to remove that component.

From the control panel, we can also view the state of the project's SQLite database. Here, we can see if the database is accessible, corrupted, or nonexistent. We can also view the disk space occupied by the database and the number of clusters created. Additionally, we can create and delete clusters, as well as view the transaction logs of the database. More information about the database and clusters can be found in Chapter 6.1.h. When the "Create cluster" button is pressed, a dialog is presented to the programmer, requesting the name and capacity of the cluster. Once the information is provided, the cluster will be created. It can then be selected in the dropdown box and deleted using the "Delete cluster" button.

The "Check storage logs" button displays the transaction logs of the database in the text box above the database status. These logs are added whenever an action such as adding information, deleting information, updating information, creating a cluster, etc., is performed. These logs can be cleared using the "Clear logs" button.
