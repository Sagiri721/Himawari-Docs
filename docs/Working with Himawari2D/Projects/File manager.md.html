<p>The file manager was created as a graphical alternative embedded in the editor, serving as a real file manager. It provides some basic functionalities such as opening files in the preferred editor, deleting files, and inspecting files. The inspection of files depends on the type of file selected. If an object is selected, it will be inspected in the inspector within the control panel. For all other files, a window will open displaying information about the file. The files displayed in the list are the resources in the selected folder in the dropdown box. This file manager allows for the management of images, sounds, objects, maps, and shaders. It also includes a small and simple code editor, which is activated when an object is double-clicked. This editor enables writing and deleting text directly in the file, eliminating the need for a third-party editor.</p>

<p>The project manager also allows for importing resources into the project. These resources include images, sounds, and fonts, as mentioned in the resource control menu previously described. Additionally, the project manager allows for the creation of rooms. Creating a room opens a window that allows for the definition of a Himawari2D room, which will be created directly in the project.</p>

<p>The map creator is simple and allows for the definition of a room name, the creation of an appropriate tileset, and the size of the map itself.</p>
